v0.1.1
======

The initial release had little to no documentation.  This release is a documentation-only update and should help immensely with getting started quickly using the module.

* Expand the README.md document.
  * Provide usage examples.
  * Discuss the history and future vision of the module.
* Add docstrings and improve comments.

v0.1.0
======

* Initial public release of canvaslms.  Public API is not stable and will likely undergo a number of changes before v1.0.0.
